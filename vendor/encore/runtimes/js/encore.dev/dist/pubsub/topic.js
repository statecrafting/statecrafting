/**
 * ExactlyOnce guarantees that a message for a subscription is delivered to
 * a consumer exactly once, to the best of the system's ability.
 *
 * However, there are edge cases when a message might be redelivered.
 * For example, if a networking issue causes the acknowledgement of success
 * processing the message to be lost before the cloud provider receives it.
 *
 * It is also important to note that the ExactlyOnce delivery guarantee only
 * applies to the delivery of the message to the consumer, and not to the
 * original publishing of the message, such that if a message is published twice,
 * such as due to an retry within the application logic, it will be delivered twice.
 * (i.e. ExactlyOnce delivery does not imply message deduplication on publish)
 *
 * As such it's recommended that the subscription handler function is idempotent
 * and is able to handle duplicate messages.
 *
 * Subscriptions attached to ExactlyOnce topics have higher message delivery latency compared to AtLeastOnce.
 *
 * By using ExactlyOnce semantics on a topic, the throughput will be limited depending on the cloud provider:
 * - AWS: 300 messages per second for the topic (see [AWS SQS Quotas]).
 * - GCP: At least 3,000 messages per second across all topics in the region
 *      (can be higher on the region see [GCP PubSub Quotas]).
